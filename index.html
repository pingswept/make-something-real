<h1>ME43: Senior Design Project</h1>
<p>The <i>Senior Design Project</i> is a capstone class taught by Brandon Stafford in the fall of 2018 at Tufts University. (There is another section taught by Dr. Kristen Wendell.)</p>
<p>The point of the class is to provide you with hands-on experience building a complex mechanical system in a team, to complement the theory that you learned in the rest of your classes. To that end, the class consists of one large project, which changes each year.</p>
