<h1>The Senior Design Project</h1>
<p>Your team's job is to design, prototype, and build a new tool.</p>
<h3>System requirements</h3>
<ul>
	<li>By "tool", we mean a device that aids a person in fabrication, assembly, simulation, or testing.</li>
	<li>The tool should not be commercially available for less than $10,000 as of September 1, 2018.</li>
	<li>The tool can have electrical or software components, but it must have a mechanical component.</li>
	<li>The tool does not need to be commercially viable, but it should be useful to someone, either a budding engineer such as yourself, or another real person in the world that you can go talk to.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Milestones</h3>
<ul>
	<li>September 13, 11:45 AM: Narrow down to three preliminary choices.</li>
	<li>September 20, 11:45 AM: Commit to a tool.</li>
	<li>September 27, 10:30 AM: Bring a proof of concept to class.</li>
	<li>October 11, 10:30 AM: Present results of user interviews.</li>
	<li>October 23, 10:30 AM: Demonstrate a prototype in class.</li>
	<li>October 30, 10:30 AM: Estimate of specifications due.</li>
	<li>November 20, 10:30 AM: Final project showcase.</li>
	<li>November 29, 10:30 AM: Technical report due.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>The Department of Mechanical Engineering will cover up to $100 per student (so $400 for a four-person team) for project expenses.</p>
