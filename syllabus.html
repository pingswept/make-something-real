    <h1>Senior Design Project syllabus</h1>
    <section>
    <p>ME 43: Senior Design Project, Section 01, class number 82003</p>
    <h2>Course description</h2>
    <p>A project-based hands-on mechanical engineering course.</p>
    <h2>Course goals</h2>
    <p>The goal of the Senior Design Project is to force students to gain experience with the practical challenges of building mechanical hardware. Acting as a counterbalance to the largely theory-heavy curriculum of the modern university, the course makes students work in teams with their mostly inexperienced peers, where they argue, break drill bits, and struggle with lightly documented hardware. They face engineering failure and have to recover to succeed.</p>
    <h2>Lecturer</h2>
    <p>Brandon Stafford, brandon.stafford@tufts.edu</p>
    <p>I check email in the morning.</p>
    <h2>Course assistant</h2>
    <p>Mark Endrizzi, a second-year Master's student in Mechanical Engineering</p>
    <h2>Office hours</h2>
    <p>Brandon's office hours are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tuesdays, noon - 1 PM in Nolop</li>
        <li>Thursdays, noon - 1 PM in Nolop</li>
        <li>any time we agree on by email</li>
        <li>any time you can find me in Nolop, but there might be a line</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mark's office hours are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wednesdays, 5-11 PM in Nolop</li>
        <li>Thursdays, 5-11 PM in Nolop</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Textbooks</h2>
    <p>There will be no textbook for the class.</p>
    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>While there may occasionally be readings or other tasks asked of you, the majority of your effort in this class will be on project work.</p>
    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>There will be no quizzes or exams. Grades will be based on your project work.</p>
    <h2>No electronics during lectures</h2>
    <p>Generally, I need too much of your attention to allow distractions like cell phones and laptops in class. There will be rare exceptions in class, like when we're using computers as tools for designing the stuff we're making. If I have to remind you about this a few times, I'll ask you to leave class. If you think this might be a problem for you, I would recommend putting your phone somewhere inaccessible during class. You should probably also think carefully about the role technology is playing in your life. (I should add that I also feel the tug of the phone, though maybe not as strongly as some of you.)</p>
    <h2>Lectures</h2>
    <p>Tu, Th 10:30-11:45 in <a href="http://campusmaps.tufts.edu/medford/#fid=205"></a>, the Science and Engineering Complex, 200 College Avenue, 1st floor, <a href="http://engineering.tufts.edu/computing/facilities/blake">Room 22, also called "Blake-Perlman Computational Studio" or "that glass room next to the cafe in the SEC."</a></p>
    <p>Project work will take place in Blake, in <a href="https://nolop.org/">Nolop</a>, and in <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/bray/">Bray Lab</a>.</p>
    <h2>Financial constraints</h2>
    <p>If, for whatever reason, you cannot afford to pay for the stuff needed for this class, please let me know, either in person or via email. In virtually all cases, the Mechanical Engineering Department will pay for whatever you can't afford; if they can't, I will. Under no circumstances should your education suffer because you don't have the right tools or supplies.</p>
    <h2>Honesty</h2>
    <p>I take honesty very seriously. Not only am I required to report violations of academic integrity, I am glad to do so. We are all fortunate to be at Tufts; there is no excuse for squandering that opportunity by representing someone else's work as your own. If you're unsure about the details, read the <a href="https://students.tufts.edu/student-affairs/student-life-policies/academic-integrity-policy">Tufts Academic Integrity Policy</a>.</p>
    <h2>Lecture plan</h2>
    <p>(New for 2019; probably not that reliable because I've only taught this class before, and I keep changing things)</p>
